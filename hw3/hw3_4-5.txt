One notable observation from the pictures in 4.4, about the distribution of digit shapes, is that the digit shapes vary in how tilted they are! This is most clear looking at the digit 1, as the shape is just a line, but varies in the angle it is tilted at. Another notable observation is that the first principal component for the digit 2 seems to show that the digit 2 is sometimes written with a little loop in the bottom left corner, as opposed to, well, a simple corner.

It is also worth noting that the digits in 4.4 are much clearer than the digits in 4.3. Naturally, this is because the digits pictured in 4.4, for example the 0, are the principal components of just images labeled as having the digit 0 in them. In 4.3, the pictures are of principal components of the entire matrix D, which has all 16 digits. So the principal components have a much more difficult job to do in capturing the images corresponding to each digit.
